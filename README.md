## Introduction

In the realm of healthcare, time optimization is crucial. This document introduces a comprehensive solution to reduce time constraints in medical processes, benefiting both patients and hospitals.

## Patient-Centric Solutions

### 1. Generalized Medical Card (GMC) with Enhanced Privacy

- **Time Efficiency:** Quickly access patient medical history, eliminating manual data retrieval during consultations.
- **Easy Hospital Resource Access:** Seamless access to medical records, test results, and prescriptions.
- **Legal Compliance:** Secure QR-coded GMC ensures data privacy and quick retrieval for legal purposes.

### 2. Nearest Hospital Locator

- **Emergency Assistance:** Quickly find the nearest hospitals during emergencies.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Choose the most convenient healthcare facility based on location.

## Hospital Efficiency Solutions

### 1. Predictive Time Management

- **Advanced Algorithm:** Estimate time required for procedures or consultations based on historical data.
- **Patient Flow Management:** Manage patient flow, reduce waiting times, and enhance satisfaction.

### 2. Efficient Access to Medical Imaging

- **QR Code Integration:** Link medical images to QR codes for swift access and review of diagnostic information.
- **Time-Saving Visualization:** Quick-view tools for medical images enable rapid analysis and diagnosis.

### 3. AI-Based Hospitals' Personalized Busy Months Prediction

- **AI-Powered Forecasting:** Predict personalized busy months based on historical patient data.
- **Effective Resource Allocation:** Allocate resources, staff, and facilities more effectively during peak periods.

### 4. AI Model for Diseases (Pneumonia Classification)

- **Efficient Diagnosis:** AI-powered classification model for pneumonia diagnosis through X-ray images.
- **Time-Saving Analysis:** Analyze entire folders of X-rays, identify pneumonia cases, and improve diagnosis accuracy.

### 5. Resource Allocation for Critical Cases

- **Urgency-Based Allocation:** Utilize urgency scores from medical reports for efficient resource allocation.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Predict when a patient might require medical attention for proactive preparation.

## How to Run Files?

### For ML Model:

1. Install the libraries from `requirements.txt` in the `ml` folder.
2. Run both models named `app.py` and `visualize_months.py`.
3. For `app.py`, use the `keras_model.h5` file to access the pre-trained model.

### For Other Files:

1. Install the `requirements.txt` in the different folder.
2. Run `main.py`!
